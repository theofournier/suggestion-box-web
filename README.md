# Automation Acceleration Action
## Suggestion Box

Each ALJâ€™s employee has some task s.he is doing on a daily basis, therefore reducing their BAU or Project efficiency. The need to target and prioritize which tasks should be on the automation team scope and therefore increase ALJ employees efficiency grows everyday as the company scale up. We are proposing a solution to this issue with the Idea Logger Project.
1. Propose an interface allowing ALJ employees to submit ideas/products/ways of improving their daily work
2. Propose an interface allowing Administrator to review/edit the ideas and easily export them
3. Send reminder to the idea submitter informing her/him of the state of the idea

This front-end is related with the Automation Acceleration Action project and connecting to Automation Acceleration Action API.
It is developed in ReactJS with Material UI.
